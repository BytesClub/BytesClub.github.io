### Adding a repository

### Contributing to an existing project

* Create a new branch while working on an issue.
* Use proper commit messages. A typical commit message should look like this: 

```
shortlog: commit message

commit body

fixes #<issue_number>
```

For more information about proper commit messages, read [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
